# Information needed for the rocket

- Mass: 1e6 [kg]
- Average Distance to the Sun:  1.52  [ua] 
- Initial angular position of the rocket: 7.6 [rad]
- Escape velocity: 28000/3.6 [m/s] # Velocity that beats Mars escape velocity (clearance site)
- Static: False


- Position vector: [R*m.cos(alpha), R*m.sen(alpha), 0]  

#See:
* R is the mean distance to the Sun from Mars 
* [sen(7.6) = co/h = y/r ,  cos(7.6) = ca/h = x/r]



#Increases speed with constant momentum.
#Fact: on day 2 the speed reaches 150,000 km/h and reaches 1.5 million km/h after 5 weeks
