## Introduction
Isaac Asimov is still considered one of the biggest science fiction writers of all time, that is why MartianFiction got curious about how much his representation of space travels could be true, that is why, using the information both from Asimov’s Tale “The Martian Way” and possible missing information based on reality, MartianFiction has done this project to represent and visualize the first travel that is described on the story given it’s starting parameters.

## Objectives
- Using the numerical data from Asimov’s story, corroborate whether it’s possible to be in orbit from Mars to Saturn using an n-body model.
- If applicable, improve some numerical data from Asimov’s story to have a better model of the journey from Mars to Saturn.
- Create a model that simulates the movement of Mars and Saturn without significant external changes.

## Toolset

- Python 3.11
- Pyplot from the Matplotlib module
- NumPy  1.19.2



## Methodology
- Observation: Get the physical measures of the space trip from Mars to Saturn narrated in The Martian Way and the physical movements of both Mars and Saturn
- Physical Theory / Law: Use Newton’s Laws of Motion and Law of Universal Gravitation. 
- Numerical Method: In this step we will calculate the missing numerical data based on the physical theory of this phenomenon. The frame of reference to be used has not yet been determined.
- Implementation: Create a n-body model. The classes and functions that will be used to implement the model are not known with certainty, however information such as: mass, speed and position will be considered.
- Validation: Run the n-body model giving other physical measures.
